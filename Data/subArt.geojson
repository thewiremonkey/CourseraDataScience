Smith said, \"The west wall depicts the designers and engineers who achieved this great engineering feat.  The north wall pays tribute to the workers who dug the tunnels and laid the 680 miles of track.  And the third panel represents the people who use the subway every day and whose lives are improved by it.\"  Smith highlights popular pastimes and haunts in the murals; on the Manhattan-bound side the Rockettes are seen kicking their heels, and on the Brooklyn-bound platform Smith depicts a brownstone with Coney Island in the background.

The artist created faces both multiethnic and androgynous, leaving room for viewers to construct for themselves stories of who these haunting forms might be and what they might signify.  The faces are constructed with steel armatures and a grid of wire mesh, which serves a protective as well as expressive function.

The work guides travelers to the surrounding streets at this busy transportation hub.  The piece celebrates the romance of the skyline as seen from Queens, imagined as the center of the city.  At a time when the New York City skyline may be associated with loss, {Look Up, Not Down} shows the skyline as an image of hope and beauty.

Historic sites and views from its past are portrayed in {Postcards from Sheepshead Bay}.  The large mural outdoors is an oversized replica of a vintage postcard that nostalgically shows a couple fishing, a jockey on horseback, and a summer home - as well as a sheepshead, the fish for which the village was named. DeBorah Goletz fancifully cut out the couples' faces, allowing people to \"stick their heads through for souvenir photos, just like the old boardwalk props,\" she says.  Inside, another mural of turn-of-the-century people, and two smaller ones, capture quiet moments on the bay.  Goletz created intricately patterned tiles with color gradations from green to blue and back to green.

Long known as the crossroads of the world, Times Square is famous for many things, but mostly for its crowds, particularly the spirited celebration each New Year's Eve when hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers and visitors-joined by television viewers around the world, gather to watch the ball drop to usher in the New Year. Sharing hopes for the future, the huge crowds are televised against a neon background.  *In {The Revelers}, Jane Dickson celebrates this age-old impulse to gather. Her mosaic artwork consists of approximately 70 expressive life-size figures. Each is in motion, walking, gesturing, linking arms, or dancing; all enjoying themselves and each other's company. The central frieze of figures are presaged by a scattering of figures in groups of two or three walking in both directions along the corridors that lead to the central open space of the station complex, near the stairs to the 1, 2, 3 lines. These smaller groups share the space with commuters traveling through the passageways that connect the subway stations at Seventh and Eighth Avenues.","art5_image1-b":"dickson1b.jpg","art5_image1-m":"dickson1m.jpg","art5_image1-s":"dickson1s.jpg","art5_image2-b":"dickson2b.jpg","art5_image2-m":"dickson2m.jpg","art5_image2-s":"dickson2s.jpg","art5_image3-b":"dickson3b.jpg","art5_image3-m":"dickson3m.jpg","art5_image3-s":"dickson3s.jpg","art5_image4-b":"dickson4b.jpg","art5_image4-m":"dickson4m.jpg","art5_image4-s":"dickson4s.jpg"},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.986754,40.754672]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"stop_id":"R25","latitude":"40.710668","longitude":"-74.011029","stop_name":"Cortlandt St","art1_title":"Trade, Treasure and Travel","art1_artist_first":"Margie","art1_artist_last":"Hughto","art1_date":"1997","art1_material":"Handmade ceramic relief tiles in passageway (closed for renovation until 2007)","art1_description":"The Cortlandt Street subway station is located beneath the site of the World Trade Center; destroyed on September 11, 2001.

The station is on the approximate site of a former roller coaster ride.  The architect, Jim McConnell of Daniel Frankfurt, wanted to transform the exterior station walls in a unique way.  Working with the architects, artist Vito Acconci developed an architectural treatment for the station facade that is full of life.  As in successful collaborations, there is no clear delineation between the architecture and the art. *Before rehabilitation, the windscreens blocked ocean views; the new windscreens open up the platform view of the Atlantic Ocean.   In the artist's words, \"The normally horizontal and vertical steel windscreen tubes and panels have been transformed into a more sinuous form that evokes the notion of a wave, or that of motion as in the Cyclone or the subway itself.\"  The result is a striking and unique subway station that fits into its special surroundings.","art1_image1_b":"Acconci-w8th1b.jpg","art1_image1_m":"Acconci-w8th1m.jpg","art1_image1_s":"Acconci-w8th1s.jpg","art1_image2_b":"Acconci-w8th2b.jpg","art1_image2_m":"Acconci-w8th2m.jpg","art1_image2_s":"Acconci-w8th2s.jpg","art1_image3_b":"Acconci-w8th3b.jpg","art1_image3_m":"Acconci-w8th3m.jpg","art1_image3_s":"Acconci-w8th3s.jpg","art1_image4_b":"Acconci-w8th4b.jpg","art1_image4_m":"Acconci-w8th4m.jpg","art1_image4_s":"Acconci-w8th4s.jpg","art1_podcast":"","art2_artist_first":"","art2_artist_last":"","art2_title":"","art2_date":"","art2_material":"","art2_description":"","art2_image1-b":"","art2_image1-m":"","art2_image1-s":"","art2_image2-b":"","art2_image2-m":"","art2_image2-s":"","art2_image3-b":"","art2_image3-m":"","art2_image3-s":"","art2_image4-b":"","art2_image4-m":"","art2_image4-s":"","art2_podcast":"","art3_artist_first":"","art3_artist_last":"","art3_title":"","art3_date":"","art3_material":"","art3_description":"","art3_image1-b":"","art3_image1-m":"","art3_image1-s":"","art3_image2-b":"","art3_image2-m":"","art3_image2-s":"","art3_image3-b":"","art3_image3-m":"","art3_image3-s":"","art3_image4-b":"","art3_image4-m":"","art3_image4-s":"","art3_podcast":"","art4_artist_first":"","art4_artist_last":"","art4_title":"","art4_date":"","art4_material":"","art4_description":"","art4_image1-b":"","art4_image1-m":"","art4_image1-s":"","art4_image2-b":"","art4_image2-m":"","art4_image2-s":"","art4_image3-b":"","art4_image3-m":"","art4_image3-s":"","art4_image4-b":"","art4_image4-m":"","art4_image4-s":"","art4_podcast":"","art5_artist_first":"","art5_artist_last":"","art5_title":"","art5_date":"","art5_material":"","art5_description":"","art5_image1-b":"","art5_image1-m":"","art5_image1-s":"","art5_image2-b":"","art5_image2-m":"","art5_image2-s":"","art5_image3-b":"","art5_image3-m":"","art5_image3-s":"","art5_image4-b":"","art5_image4-m":"","art5_image4-s":""},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-73.975939,40.576127]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"stop_id":"121","latitude":"40.788644","longitude":"-73.976218","stop_name":"86 St","art1_title":"Westside Views","art1_artist_first":"Nitza","art1_artist_last":"Tufino","art1_date":"1989","art1_material":"Ceramic tile on platform walls","art1_description":"{Westside Views} began when the local Community Board recommended that developer amenity funds be used for a youth project to benefit the community.
