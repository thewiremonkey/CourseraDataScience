West 8th St-New York Aquarium	40.576127	-73.975939	"F,Q"	Vito Acconci (Acconci Studio)	Wavewall	2005	"Steel, ceramic tile, granite, fiberglass"	"The inspiration for the station's design was local sites - the historic Coney Island boardwalk and Cyclone roller coaster, the aquarium next to the station, and area beaches.  The station is on the approximate site of a former roller coaster ride.  The architect, Jim McConnell of Daniel Frankfurt, wanted to transform the exterior station walls in a unique way.  Working with the architects, artist Vito Acconci developed an architectural treatment for the station fa?ade that is full of life.  As in successful collaborations, there is no clear delineation between the architecture and the art. *Before rehabilitation, the windscreens blocked ocean views; the new windscreens open up the platform view of the Atlantic Ocean.   In the artist's words, ?The normally horizontal and vertical steel windscreen tubes and panels have been transformed into a more sinuous form that evokes the notion of a wave, or that of motion as in the Cyclone or the subway itself.?  The result is a striking and unique subway station that fits into its special surroundings."	in collaboration with Daniel Frankfurt	"<a href=""http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=F&station=1"">Wavewall</a>"

The artist created the proposal in 2004 and, working with Dattner Architects, selected the site in an expansive wall facing a double-wide stairway and landing that leads from the mezzanine to the platforms of the A, C, B, D and 1 trains. Titled {Whirls and twirls (MTA)}, the artwork is 53 feet wide and by 11 feet high and consists of 250 porcelain tiles in six colors, each cut to meet the artist's specifications. The artist created the drawing/maquette for the project, reviewed and selected materials, and approved color samples prior to his death in 2007. *The artist is known for his sculptures and his wall drawings, in which detailed directions are provided for the execution of the artwork in paint or pencil. The site-specific piece - unique because it is a permanent public installation of a wall drawing - is a bravura work of precision, with swooping curves and vertical and horizontal bars in vibrant color that completely fills the space. The tile was cut to the exact dimensions of the drawing to ensure that the scale of the work and the color sequences are as the artist intended. *Sol LeWitt (1928-2007) is a celebrated artist who has had hundreds of solo exhibitions in museums and galleries worldwide since 1965. His work includes more than 1,100 wall drawings, photographs, hundreds of works on paper, and geometry-based sculptures. An exhibition at Mass MOCA in North Adams, Massachusetts, features 105 wall drawings in a specially designed museum space and will be on view through 2033."

South Ferry	40.702068	-74.013664	1	Doug & Mike Starn	"See it split, see it change"	2009	"Glass, stone mosaic, and stainless steel on mezzanine walls"	"The new monumental work at the South Ferry Terminal by Mike and Doug Starn investigates the nature of objects and transformation using light and documentary sources. A fused glass wall reveals images of tree limbs and leaves in silhouette adapted from photographic imagery. These formations relate to the place above, Battery Park, the historic fortress and Manhattan's southern boundary. The glass brings light and poetry to the station, the City's first new subway station in decades. *Companion pieces show a decayed over-scaled leaf that refers to the passage of time and links the park to its historical role. A map, that shows contemporary Manhattan and old New York as an overla,Y is a beautiful mosaic and eloquent expression of the city's evolution, conveying to the throngs who use the station, a sense of its significant location. The artists designed a laser-cut stainless steel fence to separate the entry from the paid section of the station; its leaf motif connects the art in the station with the surrounding environment. *The Starns' work combines various forms, such as sculpture, painting, video, and installation. Their work has been exhibited in museums and galleries worldwide for more than two decades. In South Ferr,Y their explorations of light and dark, nature and technolog,Y come together in an evocative artwork. Its title refers, among other associations, to the South Ferry subway line, which becomes a network of splitting lines that travels through the changing landscape as seen in the map. As the artwork reveals, the City and its lifelines evolve in an organic form, as dropping leaves lead to new growth, the City keeps growing - and changing."

231st St	40.878856	-73.904834	1	Felipe Galindo	Magic Realism in Kingsbridge	2008	Faceted glass in platform windscreens	"In the past it might have been easy for Kingsbridge area residents to go about their daily business without a thought given to their neighborhood's history and surroundings-places like  Kingsbridge Hills, Ewen Park, Harlem River, Jerome Park Reservoir, and Spuyten Duyvil Creek. This is no longer the case. Felipe Galindo's {Magic Realism in Kingsbridge} stems from his study of the area's residents and his hopes that the imagery in his designs will engage the audience, inspiring them to meditate on their surroundings and see things they take for granted in a different way. *Galindo says he sought to discover the unexpected treasures in the neighborhood-its life, diversit,Y nature, and most of all the power of imagination. Each element in the faceted glass panels presents a surprising scene. For example, a tropical island is found in the Harlem River, and a fire escape leads to the heavens, providing a sense of magic.  Galindo feels that his artwork, with its combination of urban, natural, surreal and historical elements, provides an opportunity for viewers to experience something intriguing or surprising each time they pass through the 231 Street subway station."

Woodlawn Av	40.886037	-73.878751	4	Josie Gonzalez Albright	Children at Play	2005	Faceted glass in mezzanine windows	"{Children at Play}, a series of faceted glass panels, is a study of silhouetted figures moving through space, in various poses and movements - pausing, spinning, crouching, sliding, and running.  Artist Josie Gonzalez Albright chose a palette of jewel tones for the children to take advantage of the luminous quality of the glass.   Speaking of the work she says, ?The scale of the children - to each other and the space that they're in - fills the frame with flowing colors that swirl around them.  The effect is that they 'move through the colors' of their environment. Warm shadows are created from the placement of glass crystals that are fused over the glass, which gives...a bubbl,Y raised texture.  Lots of clear glass allows for light from adjacent colored glass pieces to spill over and create new color combinations throughout the day.?"
