Among the colorful roster of Cubs players were both Ernie Banks and Ron Santo, who helped the home team come from behind to win the game with a score of 3 to 2. The box score symbols, re-created here in bronze, are derived from samples of Cubs broadcaster Ron Santo's own writing. The Padres' sixth inning is represented on the interior facades of the elevator towers, facing the passenger platform, and the Cubs' ninth inning is represented on the exterior facade of the east elevator tower. Cubs management was instrumental in procuring writing samples, and granted the artist permission to duplicate Mr. Santo's writing.  ",

Each interview was captured by the artist in an audio recording. The artist then visited and photographed the scene of each event, free of people, creating a unique portrait of each individual's memory while also allowing viewers of the artwork to vicariously visit each location.
