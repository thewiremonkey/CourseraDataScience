As the luminous images appear in perpetual motion and the burned wood speaks of disaster, we are reminded of the impermanence of nature, while the steel framework and bolt system indicate man’s ability to rebuild that which has been destroyed.

Using the traditional method of baseball score-keeping, the sculpture describes the top half of the sixth inning and the bottom half of the ninth inning of the May 14, 1969 baseball game between the Chicago Cubs and the San Diego Padres. Among the colorful roster of Cubs players were both Ernie Banks and Ron Santo, who helped the home team come from behind to win the game with a score of 3 to 2. The box score symbols, re-created here in bronze, are derived from samples of Cubs broadcaster Ron Santo’s own writing. The Padres’ sixth inning is represented on the interior façades of the elevator towers, facing the passenger platform, and the Cubs’ ninth inning is represented on the exterior façade of the east elevator tower. Cubs management was instrumental in procuring writing samples, and granted the artist permission to duplicate Mr. Santo’s writing.  "

The ceramic tiles of this artwork reflect the strength of community as a whole, but also the uniqueness of its individual parts. Many of the design elements are drawn from architectural details of homes, schools and commercial buildings, as well as structural details associated with the CTA. These sources reflect the current community and give reference to the history of the neighborhood. Combined with this imagery are design elements inspired by connections of heritage to Mayan, Aztec and African cultures."	Arts in Transit
