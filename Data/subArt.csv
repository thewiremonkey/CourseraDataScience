The artist explains his concept:  ’As a unit they form a composite to symbolically show as in a 'union' the best of each part of racialYYY religiousYYY and cultural life make the most positive picture.  The community above the Union Street station is mirrored in these panels because they are successfully working at making their community into this reality.’  AdditionallyYYY the station has a series of track wall panels designed by the artist.

Perhaps more than any image in the ten panels that compose {Children's Cathedral}YYY this demonstrates the artist's intentions:  to reflect the desiresYYY dreams and memories of the community's children in their own drawings.  ’At firstYYY’ he saysYYY ’I talked with the kids about how they playYYY learnYYY prayYYY and celebrate.  Then they drew.’  What emerged were images of the neighborhood: shopsYYY a woman pushing a baby carriageYYY a teacher in classYYY plantsYYY flowersYYY andYYY most of allYYY children in action: singing in choirYYY jumping ropeYYY readingYYY riding bikes.

As he described his workYYY ’[This site] is undergroundYYY in the 'earth'YYY under an urban setting...  Rocks are interspersed among tiles. The rocks in this situation could actually have been a part of the excavation process for the subway tunnel ... [and they] thus become a symbol for the process of building the tunnel and for being underground... The path and stairs as well as the tiles ... intermingle nature with the man-made. The built aspect of the stairs also alludes to the built environmentYYY the city. The landscape could be the kind of place that was here before this was an urban center ...  The curve [of the tunnel] ... was also the perfect opportunity to twist the perspective of the staircase to reiterate the curve and suggest the going from one type of environment to another.’		"<a href=""http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=2&station=1"">Subway Wall</a>"

The event was the Civil War; the inventionYYY the development of canned milkYYY in great demand by the Union army for its soldiers.

West 8th St-New York Aquarium	40.576127	-73.975939	FYYYQ	Vito Acconci (Acconci Studio)	Wavewall	2005	SteelYYY ceramic tileYYY graniteYYY fiberglass	The inspiration for the station's design was local sites - the historic Coney Island boardwalk and Cyclone roller coasterYYY the aquarium next to the stationYYY and area beaches.  The station is on the approximate site of a former roller coaster ride.  The architectYYY Jim McConnell of Daniel FrankfurtYYY wanted to transform the exterior station walls in a unique way.  Working with the architectsYYY artist Vito Acconci developed an architectural treatment for the station façade that is full of life.  As in successful collaborationsYYY there is no clear delineation between the architecture and the art. *Before rehabilitationYYY the windscreens blocked ocean views; the new windscreens open up the platform view of the Atlantic Ocean.   In the artist's wordsYYY ’The normally horizontal and vertical steel windscreen tubes and panels have been transformed into a more sinuous form that evokes the notion of a waveYYY or that of motion as in the Cyclone or the subway itself.’  The result is a striking and unique subway station that fits into its special surroundings.	in collaboration with Daniel Frankfurt	"<a href=""http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=F&station=1"">Wavewall</a>"

The viewer notices complex compositions with layers of color and texture that place the animals in a lush settings.  The location of the work at the West Farms Square-East Tremont Avenue station is not coincidental; nearby is the world-famous Bronx Zoo.  The artist says that she considers {Animal Tracks} to be an integration of her past involvement in animal sciences with her art and ’a step toward the unity and community feeling paramount to our steps in the future.’  {Animal Tracks} serves as an introduction to the zoo to visitors just arriving at the stationYYY and a reminder of the trip to those heading home.

The sculpture respects the physical constraints of the station architecture and succeeds in reshaping them through the use of light and materials to construct a powerful memorial to the Lost Battalion - a group of World War I soldiersYYY mostly New YorkersYYY who were lost in battle.  Pablo Tauler uses materials that eerily suggests the Argonne Forest where the soldiers met their fate.  Muscular steel slabs evoke armaments glass refracts lightYYY and organically shaped iron forms twist like branches.  For the sculptor the ironwork inspires memories of the wilderness marshes near his childhood home.  ’I am profoundly aware of the importance of the environment to my artYYY’ he says.  ’Especially interesting to me is the manipulation of light through the use of texture and reflective materials.’		"<a href=""http://web.mta.info/mta/aft/permanentart/permart.html?agency=nyct&line=G&station=1"">In Memory of the Lost Battalion</a>"

Artist Josie Gonzalez Albright chose a palette of jewel tones for the children to take advantage of the luminous quality of the glass.   Speaking of the work she saysYYY ’The scale of the children - to each other and the space that they're in - fills the frame with flowing colors that swirl around them.  The effect is that they 'move through the colors' of their environment. Warm shadows are created from the placement of glass crystals that are fused over the glassYYY which gives...a bubblyYYY raised texture.
